By Khajira Christopher

## Description
This website is a Caesar Cipher that allows the user to either encrypt or decrypt words. 
The user is given three options: first, to encrypt; second, to decrypt; third; to exit the program. If the user chooses
to encrypt, he is prompted to provide the word(s) that he would like to encrypt. The user is also prompted to enter the
shift key which determines how many places the words are shifted. The user is then given the encrypted word. The user 
can then choose to exit the program by selecting option 3.
If the user chooses option 2, to decrypt, he is prompted to provide the word(s) that he would like to decrypt. The user 
is also prompted to enter the shift key which was used to encrypt. The user is then given the decrypted word. 
The user can then choose to exit the program by selecting option 3.
